              The Marrow Thieves is a dystopian book that explores moral dilemmas in a tough world.
               The characters have to make difficult choices that test their moral values, challenge
                their identity and culture as they navigate through a harsh reality. Near the start 
                of the book, French talks about his nickname Frenchie “I was nicknamed Frenchie as much for my name as for my people—the Metis. 
                I came from a long line of hunters, trappers, and voyageurs. But now, with most of the 
                rivers cut into pieces and lakes left as grey sludge puckers on the landscape, my own 
                history seemed like a myth along the lines of dragons” (Dimaline 24). French tells us 
                how his culture are perceived primarily through the lens of their ethnic background. The 
                destruction of the natural landscape and the disappearance of traditional practices
                have eroded their connection to their history. I relate to this theme of grappling 
                with identity. It made me reflect on times when I felt conflicted about my identity 
                and tried to conform to fit societal expectations. In the middle of the novel, French 
                says, "He'd lost someone he'd built a life with right in the middle of that life. 
                Suddenly, I realized that there was something worse than running, worse even than the 
                schools. There was loss" (Dimaline 99). This resonates deeply when reflecting on personal 
                experiences of loss, Losing my grandmother was like losing a vital part of my life, leaving 
                a big hole in my heart. We had this amazing connection built over the years, and her absence 
                went beyond just not being there physically. It was the love, guidance, and special memories 
                we shared that I missed the most. Her passing made me realize that there's something even 
                worse than the pain of losing someone—it's the lasting emptiness that comes with it. Just 
                like the characters in "The Marrow Thieves" who face tough situations, my own experience 
                taught me that the emotional toll of grief is way heavier than any external hardships. It 
                reaches deep into your soul, leaving a mark that goes beyond the immediate sadness. Dealing 
                with loss becomes a journey of healing and understanding the complicated nature of grief. It 
                also helps me relate better to others who've gone through similar losses and appreciate the 
                inner strength it takes to navigate through the aftermath of such a profound emotional upheaval.
