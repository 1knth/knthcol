              When I first chose The Marrow Thieves as my INS novel, I had low expectations. 
                This is caused by prior learning experiences in elementary in middle school 
                where there was a repeat in talking about residential schools. I thought that 
                the book would just be another history trip back to the treaties and residential 
                schools using a modern medium such as a dystopian novel. As I read through the 
                entire book, I realized I had made my judgement too quickly. The Marrow Thieves 
                by Cherie Dimaline, taught me a lot about resilience and family. Throughout the 
                novel, French and the family face the constant threat of being hunted for their 
                bone marrow. Despite these harsh realities, they still manage to be resilient and 
                adapt to their circumstances. Although not blood-related, Miig’s “family” are still 
                able to find strength in their shared experiences and support one another in their 
                pursuit of survival and freedom while many others facing the same situation would
                treat it like saying “Everyone for themselves.” This is evident when we see French 
                kill Travis in a fit of rage over the brutal death of RiRi, a seven year-old girl 
                that has been traveling with Miig’s family, that flashed right in front of his eyes. 
                French repeatedly mentions hearing people around him try to reason as he “cocked the 
                barrel and trained it” on Travis. He swiftly dismisses these actions by simply blaming 
                it as “just the wind” (Dimaline 122). As “Panic flashed” across Travis’ face, it 
                quickly “settled into a look of soft, practiced pleading” which was the only time that 
                French “felt anger through it all, seeing that rehearsed mask slip over his dark face” 
                (Dimaline 122). This reminds me that not all family has to be bound by blood. Family 
                can be formed through deep connections, shared experiences, and trust. This also reminds 
                us that family can be found in the places we least expect and that the actions we recieve 
                from these people can be just as meaningful as that of our biological families.
