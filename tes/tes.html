            “Peoplehood is made up of four things territory, sacred history, ceremonial cycle 
            and language. Each thread informs the other, you can’t address a single aspect of 
            it without looking at the whole” (Thomas 3:55).

            “Two-eyed seeing, takes the strengths of both a colonized world and both an indigenous 
            and asks that the user see through both lenses simultaneously to find success. It is 
            the Mi'kmaq understanding of the gift of multiple perspectives” (8:39).

              Rebecca Thomas's TED Talk on "Etuaptmumk: Two-Eyed Seeing" offers a thought-provoking 
              exploration of Indigenous knowledge and its integration with Western science. Throughout 
              her presentation, Thomas emphasizes the importance of embracing diverse perspectives and 
              understanding the interconnection between all living beings. In her talk, Thomas shares
              personal stories and experiences rooted in her Mi'kmaw heritage, highlighting the wisdom 
              and deep understanding embedded within Indigenous ways of knowing. She challenges the 
              dominant Western paradigm that often dismisses or devalues Indigenous knowledge systems, 
              emphasizing the need for a more inclusive approach to learning and problem-solving. She 
              introduces the Elder Albert Marshall’s idea of Etuaptmumk. This is the practice of seeing 
              “through both lenses simultaneously." Rebecca mentions that the concept of Etuaptmumk, “takes 
              the strengths of both a colonized world and an indigenous world” which help the user find 
              success.” By embracing multiple perspectives, individuals can attain a deeper understanding 
              and navigate complex issues more effectively. The quote highlights the importance of recognizing 
              the wisdom and insights offered by different cultural perspectives. Two-eyed seeing invites 
              individuals to exceed the limitations of a single worldview and appreciate the richness 
              that comes from blending multiple lenses. By using this approach, people can foster mutual 
              learning, empathy, and collaboration, which all in all leads to success in addressing challenges 
              and creating a more inclusive society. Later, Rebecca talks about peoplehood. She mentions 
              that peoplehood is made up of four things, “territory, sacred history, ceremonial cycle, and 
              language." She encapsulates the interdependence of these elements. Territory shapes identity 
              and connections to the land, while sacred history encompasses ancestral narratives and cultural 
              foundations. The ceremonial cycle preserves traditions and fosters communal bonds, and language 
              carries cultural nuances and generations of wisdom. Understanding and respecting the 
              interconnectedness of these components is crucial to honor and engage with Indigenous 
              communities authentically. This concept resonates beyond Indigenous cultures, as it highlights 
              the significance of embracing the complexity and interplay of diverse identities. Overall, 
              Rebecca Thomas's TED Talk on Two-eyed seeing leaves us with a profound understanding of the 
              power of embracing multiple perspectives. It challenges the western world to question our own 
              biases, broaden our worldview, and actively engage in building a more inclusive and harmonious 
              society. By adopting the principles of Two-eyed seeing, we can contribute to a world that 
              celebrates diversity, values cultural heritage, and promotes a deeper sense of understanding and
              connection among all people.
